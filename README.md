# FACE-RECOGNITION- 
This project explores the use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for facial recognition, leveraging their cutting-edge architecture to address the challenges of traditional methods. ViTs utilize the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies within images, enabling them to process higher resolutions and provide a comprehensive global analysis of facial features.

By focusing on feature extraction and pattern recognition, ViTs have the potential to revolutionize facial recognition by improving accuracy, robustness, and scalability compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project demonstrates the application of ViTs to real-world datasets, aiming to push the boundaries of computer vision.
